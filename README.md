I haven not learned much from this one, the instructor was super quick and has not explained much of what he did. But in the end, I am familiar with most of the concepts of what the author went over. I found a bug at the end and succesfully resolved it...as always, it was a typo. Continuing on new courses about react todo apps. Happy coding.
